== Introduction and Document Scope

Pull requests are modification requests in software development when a developer creates a unit of change in the source code and requests that the modifications get incorporated into the "master" source code and thus become part of the project.

The aim of the pull request, as a code review process, is to provide extra quality assurance means to the software development, ensuring that at least two people review every change.

Handling pull requests is a multi-step workflow with several parties participating.
During the process, the parties communicate, discuss different opinions, and point out problems in the code.
Practice shows that this process can lead to interpersonal problems and human conflicts.

This document gives technical and non-technical guidelines to follow to avoid human conflicts and optimize the process, aiming at the highest possible efficiency.

=== Notes

These guidelines are mainly programming language agnostic.
Language-specific guidelines are denoted in the section title between parentheses, e.g., (Java).

The guidelines are independent of the tool used.
However, the guidelines are expressed in a way assuming the use of git and GitHub.
This is because most of the applications of the guides will use git.
Nevertheless, the guides are general and can be adapted to other tools.
Basic knowledge and understanding of git is assumed.

=== Process Actors

There are at least two actors in the pull request process.
One actor asks the pull and the other one merges the change to the "master" source.

The detailed model defines four actors:

requester:: the actor who is requesting the change and the merge
commenter:: actor who makes suggestions, and comments on the changed code
approver:: the actor who approves the change
merger:: the actor who performs the merging

Most of the executions of the PR handling can be described using this model, assigning one or more acting roles to the individual participants.
The *requester* should eventually be a separate person, but one or more of the roles *commenter*, *approver* and *merger* may be assigned to a single person.
At the same time, there can be more than one person for each of these roles, although a single person will execute the actual merging of a single pull request.

A more detailed description of how the different roles can be assigned to different personnel and what assignment structures may work can be part of a document describing the actual PR handling procedure.
This document does not cover that specific topic.

== Definitions

PR:: pull request

IDE:: Integrated Development Environment, like Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans

PR code:: is the code that the developer created in its branch and that is to be merged in the pull request process

main code:: is the source code in the main branch.
This is the code into which the PR code is merged into

== Guidelines

=== Scope of a Pull Request

====
A single PR should focus on one single functional or non-functional change.
====

If there are multiple changes, then they have to be developed in separate branches, and their incorporation into the main branch (usually `main`) should utilize multiple PRs.

Two changes may share some common code change parts.
In that case, there are two different approaches:

image::images/pullrequest/dependencies.png[]

. Order the changes; the first change contains the common part of the two changes.
In this case, the second change depends on the first one.
Use this if the changes are not too big and creating a third PR would be too much overhead. `F1` <- `F2`

. Create a change that contains only the common part that the other two changes depend on, and the separate changes depend only on this common change.
In that case, we have the `C` common change and the two changes `C` <- `F1` && `C` <- `F2`, but the two changes `F1` and `F2` are independent.
Use this if the changes are not trivial and splitting them into smaller parts makes sense.
Also, when the changes are complex, it cannot be foreseen which change is going to be reviewed first.
That way, `F1` and `F2` do not block each other.

=== Code Cleanup

====
Code Cleanup should be in a separate pull request.
====

When developing a new feature, it is sometimes tempting to modify code to improve the overall general structure of the code.
These changes should be moved to a separate PR if possible.

For example, you may need to modify a method to implement a change, and there is a `for` loop that you can alter to be more modern for each style or even to use Java 8 streams.
If the code inside the loop is modified for the change implementation, then the loop modification can be part of the exact change.
It is a code cleanup of a code that is changed.
If the for loop is not altered and there is code change only before and/or after the loop, then the loop change may not be a good decision.

^Cleaning^ ^up^ ^code^ ^that^ ^changes:^ ^OK,^ ^cleaning^ ^up^ ^where^ ^code^ ^does^ ^not^ ^change:^ ^Not^ ^OK^

If there is any doubt about changing the code in the same pull request, it is a safe choice not to include the change in the specific pull request.

This recommendation does not mean that code cleanup should not be done.
On the contrary, code cleanup is essential and deserves its separate pull request.

=== Import Optimization

====
Import Optimization is code cleanup and thus should be in a separate pull request.
====

This section makes sense only for languages with `import` in the source code.

Import optimization is the act of one or more of the following actions:

* removing import statements that are not needed anymore
* rearrange the order of import statements (including grouping)
* change wild-card import statements into explicit or vice versa according to local policies.

The IDE usually performs import optimizations automatically when the code is formatted and saved.
When the main code has different optimization rules (ordering, grouping), the import optimization creates extra differences in the PR with no functional relevance.

It may also happen that import statements in the checked-in code are often redundant and not coherent with the local policies.
It is advised to enforce the local development bylaws using static code analysis to avoid such a situation.

PRs must avoid import optimizations that are not related to the actual change.

A change may eliminate the use of a class or method available through an import statement.
In that case, removing the import statement should eventually be part of the PR.

(Java) The opposite situation is when a change requires importing a class or method (static import).
In that case, the PR should eventually contain the change of the `import` statements.
The fact that the PR should contain the new `import` statement(s) is obvious.
Without that, the code in the PR would not compile.

(Java) When the change in the code uses some statically imported method, the new static import should eventually be part of the PR.
The other way around is when the code uses some previously statically imported methods, but the PR code uses the method with the full name.
In this case, as the code uses the class name, it is possible to delete the static import.
The deletion of such static import should be part of the PR.
Deleting the static import statement is the consequence of the code change.
This case is equivalent to the one when a class is not used anymore; thus, it is not imported anymore.

In other cases, the optimization of the import statements should not be part of the PR.
A separate PR should contain only import optimization and possibly other code cleanup.

=== Formatting Change

====
Formatting change is cleanup and thus should be in a separate pull request.
====

It is straightforward to modify the formatting of the code.
When the PR contains many formatting changes, the actual code change may easily be overseen in the numerous formatting changes.
This is something to avoid.

If (1) the local formatting (very specifically, the developers' IDE formatting setting) is the same as the project setting, and (2) the main code is well-formatted, then the PR request will not contain any reformatted line that is not new, deleted, or changed.
Formatting clutter in the PR is only possible in two cases:

* when there is a different setting in the developer IDE and/or
* the main code is not formatted properly.

To avoid that situation (*formatting recommendations*)

* it is recommended to have well-defined formatting rules defining the use of tab characters and space characters for formatting
* placement of opening and closing braces (if the language uses those),
* needed spaces between specific tokens (e.g. between `if(...)` and the `{` character)
* tool has to enforce the formatting and automatically signal the PR as build broken if the formatting does not match the rules,
* developers are provided with formatting configurations for the different IDEs accepted and used for the development.

The PR requester has to undo the formatting changes that are not supposed to be in the PR (1) in the first place.

If the reformatting is needed because the main code is not well formatted, (2) then two separate PRs should be created: one for the changes and one for the reformatting.
These changes depend on each other.
The actual order should reflect the urgency and importance of the changes.
Usually, formatting has lower priority than other changes.

When the formatting changes cause a significant problem during the PR handling, it is recommended to

* introduce the formatting recommendations (itemized above),
* reformat the code of the whole project to be coherent with the formatting rules and
* merge this change into the master in one PR that contains no other change.
